### Context API

The Context API allows you to create a global state and share it across your application without the need to pass props manually at every level. It is ideal for simpler applications or when you need to manage a small amount of global state. However, it can become cumbersome in large-scale applications with complex state dependencies.

Example:

```jsx
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from "react";

const CountContext = createContext();

function Child() {
  const count = useContext(CountContext);
  return <p>Shared Count: {count}</p>;
}

function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <CountContext.Provider value={count}>
      <div>
        <p>Parent Count: {count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        <Child />
      </div>
    </CountContext.Provider>
  );
}

```

### Redux

Redux is a library for managing global state in a predictable and scalable way. It is more suitable for large-scale applications where state management becomes complex and involves multiple interconnected components. Redux provides a structured approach to handle state changes using actions and reducers, ensuring consistency and traceability.

Example:

```jsx
import { createStore } from "redux";
import { Provider, useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";

// Reducer function
function counterReducer(state = 0, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return state + 1;
    case "decrement":
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

const store = createStore(counterReducer);

function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "increment" })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "decrement" })}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <Counter />
    </Provider>
  );
}

```

### When to Use Context API vs Redux

- **Context API:**
   - Ideal for smaller applications or when you need to share a few pieces of state across components.
   - Simpler setup, as it is built into React and doesn't require additional libraries.
   - Works well for static or less dynamic state, such as themes, user authentication status, or localization.
- **Redux:**
   - Suitable for larger applications with complex state logic that needs to be shared across many components.
   - Provides tools for debugging and tracing state changes (e.g., Redux DevTools).
   - Better for applications where you need fine-grained control over state updates or asynchronous state changes (e.g., API calls).

The choice between Context API and Redux often depends on the complexity and scalability needs of your application.
